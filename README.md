### Summary

MeloTunes is a react based project that uses the Itunes Search API and Firebase database/authentication. The purpose of the app is that a user can create and login to an account and use the search function to find songs which they like and store them in a playlist. This playlist can then be bought in the playlist section of the app and then the user can create a new playlist and buy it. The playlist can also be sorted by the user in the way they like. They can also view information about the song such as the cost, total playtime, release date, genre and the collection. In the playlist section where the "checkout" is happening the user has a specific amount of money to spend. If there isn't enough money to buy a playlist, the user has the alternative to insert more money (simulation).
